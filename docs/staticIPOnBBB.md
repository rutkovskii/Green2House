To give a permanent IP address to a BeagleBone, you can configure it to use a static IP address instead of obtaining one dynamically from a DHCP server. Here are the general steps:

Connect to the BeagleBone: Connect to the BeagleBone via SSH or a serial connection.

Edit the network configuration file: Open the /etc/network/interfaces file using a text editor:

`$ sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces`
Configure the static IP address: Add the following lines to the bottom of the file to configure the static IP address:

````auto eth0
iface eth0 inet static
address <IP address>
netmask <netmask>
gateway <default gateway>
dns-nameservers <DNS servers>```
Replace <IP address> with the desired static IP address, <netmask> with the netmask of the network (usually 255.255.255.0), <default gateway> with the IP address of the default gateway, and <DNS servers> with the IP addresses of one or more DNS servers (separated by spaces).

For example, if you want to give the BeagleBone a static IP address of 192.168.1.100, with netmask 255.255.255.0, default gateway 192.168.1.1, and DNS server 8.8.8.8, you would add the following lines:


```auto eth0
iface eth0 inet static
address 192.168.1.100
netmask 255.255.255.0
gateway 192.168.1.1
dns-nameservers 8.8.8.8```
Save and exit the file: Press Ctrl+X, then Y, then Enter to save the changes and exit the editor.

Restart the networking service: Restart the networking service to apply the changes:


```$ sudo service networking restart```
After completing these steps, the BeagleBone should use the static IP address you configured instead of obtaining one dynamically from a DHCP server. Note that you may need to update any other devices or services that rely on the BeagleBone's IP address to use the new static IP address.
