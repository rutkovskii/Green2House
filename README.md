# Green2House

## Project by Team 3 for Senior Design Project

## Abstract 
As people seek to eat healthier and live cleaner lives it can be very challenging to do in an efficient manner. One way people are looking to do this is through home gardening, which has a large room for improvement and has not yet been made smart and efficient on a small scale. Green2House aims to provide a smart portable greenhouse allowing for individuals to grow plants without as much hassle for watering them and keeping them protected.
